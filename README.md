# Data Visualization and Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset
In this project, I did an in-depth analysis and visualization of the titanic dataset which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The goal of the project is to understand the relationship between characteristic features of titanic passengers and their survival rate, and train a logistic regression model to predict the survival rate.

## Data Visualization
For data visualization, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) libraries are used to understand the impact of the following features on a passenger's survival rate:
- Age
- Sex
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Port of Embarkation
- Number of family members on board (siblings & spouses)

## Logistic Regression
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) are used to train a logistic regression model.

## Requirements
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## Sub-directories
- *ml_model.ipynb* --- is the jupyter notebook of the complete project.
- *predicted_data.csv* --- contains survival rate predicted by the model.
